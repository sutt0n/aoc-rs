- i'm going to be mapping shit out here... because i need to a better way to understand this better.

1. mining-proxy
  - `main` called
  - global static `ROUTING_LOGIC` set to `initialize_r_logic(upstreams)`
    - initialize_r_logic():
      -

- maybe can use ROUTING_LOGIC to route messages?

select_upstream() was not the right approach to implement the switching logic... 
it seems to be that we need to implement routing logic for channels in regards to percentage
mapping things out seem to be going well. right now, it's just continuing to play around with things. the proxy works as such (shitty drawing):

POOL 1 ---\  ____             ____ 
                [U] PROXY [D]|     > MINING NODE
POOL 2 ---/  ‾‾‾‾             ‾‾‾‾

where [U] is the upstream and [D] is the downstream...

the proxy seems to have a tcp connection for each upstream and a listener for N number of nodes (e.g. mining devices). 
it utilizes channels to dispatch messages across these TCP connections appropriately. we need to somehow dissect 
this logic in order to tweak it and appropriately switch messages from mining nodes to appropriate upstreams / pools.

we have a configuration `UpstreamMiningNode.percentage<u8>` set for upstreams; we just need to be able to pull that information in 
on the channel logic and dispatch appropriately based on the internal `UpstreamMiningNode.relay_count` and calculate from there.

in order to dispatch appropriately, we'll probably need to find a way to read the channel logic / map... 

...

now that i'm thinking about this, this shouldn't be a message type... that would be way too hacky. 
we could have a dedicated "switch" connection that's being listened to by the proxy.
this _could_ be another upstream with a specific Channel Kind type, e.g. ProxySwitch

tonight i found out that there's a bit for reconnecting via Mining::Reconnect. it's a message from the upstream to the downstream. 
if i can find a way to trigger that with the arguments including the new host and port, we should be in business. we don't want to 
change anything in the protocols.

not much time to tinker with sv2 tonight as much as i wanted...

...i am going to get a halfass working example going, i think. i didn't think i'd get this far, but 
things are looking _maybe_ promising... we'll see...

as an aside, i haven't done an AoC puzzle today. maybe we can tomorrow. i'm too high for this.
as another aside, the front flowerbed looks great. i hope the hydrangeas will live. they looked
sad whenever we transplanted them into the ground. i hope they'll take. fingers crossed.
